# Interface segragation principle (ISP):

## Definition
*Don't depends on things you don't need.*

ISP is about preventing inadvertent coupling between a client and some behaviors he/she wonâ€™t need.

Source code dependencies can force recompilation and redeployment even if the things you need haven't changed.
